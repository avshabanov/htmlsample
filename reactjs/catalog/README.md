# Catalog Sample

This is an illustration of close-to-real-world react application that uses REST API.

Uses `Makefile + npm` to build client app and launch test nodejs server.
Also includes things like favicon, robots.txt and layout closer to what you want to have in real app.

Uses ES2015 syntax and react transformations.
